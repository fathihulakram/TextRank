# Text Summarization using TextRank Algorithm

## Abstract
Reading long and prolix articles can cause a hassle to some readers, such as when they decided that the articles are not worth reading, only after reading a huge part of them. To overcome this issue, there is a solution that can be implemented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, namely text summarization. Text summarization is all about shortening a lengthy article and summarizing it with high conciseness and succinctness. One of the approaches of text summarization is by implementing TextRank algorithm. TextRank ranks all the sentences in the article and displays the highest sentences in the summary.
