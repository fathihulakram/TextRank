# Text Summarization using TextRank Algorithm

Summarization is the act of reducing a long text to its most essential points while preserving its overall meaning. This can be done manually, but it is time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, the use of automation for text summarization is becoming increasingly popular in academic research. The goal of this project is to develop a text summarization model using the extractive approach and the Textrank algorithm.
